## Work Experience
**01/09/2023-01/10/2023 Mangalore, India**
**Data Scienctist- MINDFUL AUTOMATION PVT. LTD.**
- Extracting tables from Arabic Invoices, and using an OCR to scape detailsand output to excel tables and jsons. 
- I used **G-cloud-vision and G-cloud-translate** api for the project. I also used **Paddle-OCR(SOTA 2022)** instead of pytesseract. It was a good learning experience.

**DATA SCIENTIST- MINDFUL AUTOMATION PVT. LTD.**
- Process of KYC(Know your customer) involves verification of official documents which consists of
sensitive information but involved human interaction. this sensitive information could get leaked, and so I
had to automate the whole process.
- I spent a good amount of time doing **data pre-processing and augmentations**, then I tweaked a lot of
algorithms to solve the problems. finally, I automated the process of verification. At first I used **RCNN** then **Faster RCNN** but hardly had any success with them.
- Finally, I used **SOTA 2020 YOLO**, to perform object detection, that gave me an accuracy of **88%**, then I performed OCR which gave me an accuracy of 90+%.

**01/11/2021 – 01/12/2021 Indore, India**
**DATA SCIENCE CONSULTANT (SELF)– KERALA FREELANCER**
- Sea weeds are medicinal herbs, but requires a lot of skilled man hours to harvest them. I was given the task to make a model to classify these weeds and harvest it using robots. But given the scarce availability of data, I was able to get 25 images from Client. CNN’s were overfitting and took 40 hours to converge with **high BIAS**.
- Finally made a **DETR(data efficient Transformer) with a 60% accuracy**.
- In the end we have to stop the project because of budget constraints in data collection, gained a lot of experience in that project.
