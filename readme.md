## Education
- M.Sc., Data Science(1st year) | Technical University, Dortmund, Germany(_October 2023_)	 			        		
- B.Sc., Applied Statistics and Analytics | Devi Ahilya University, Indore, India (_June 2022_)

## Work Experience
Mostly worked on **Freelancing projects**, Also I did a lot of small projects for a lot of individuals, which couldn't be mentioned here for privacy reasons.

1. **Data Scientist- MINDFUL AUTOMATION PVT. LTD.**
- **Arabic Billing OCR**
- - Extracting tables from Arabic Invoices, and using an OCR to scape detailsand output to excel tables and jsons. [CHECK OUT PROJECT](https://github.com/shyamgupta196/Arabic-ocr)
- - I used **G-cloud-vision and G-cloud-translate** api for the project. I also used **Paddle-OCR(SOTA 2022)** instead of pytesseract. It was a good learning experience.

- **KYC**
- - Process of KYC(Know your customer) involves verification of official documents which consists of
sensitive information but involved human interaction. this sensitive information could get leaked, and so I
had to automate the whole process.
- - I spent a good amount of time doing **data pre-processing and augmentations**, then I tweaked a lot of
algorithms to solve the problems. finally, I automated the process of verification. At first I used **RCNN** then **Faster RCNN** but hardly had any success with them.
- - Finally, I used **SOTA 2020 YOLO**, to perform object detection, that gave me an accuracy of **88%**, then I performed OCR which gave me an accuracy of 90+%.

2. **DATA SCIENCE CONSULTANT (SELF)â€“ KERALA FREELANCER**
- **Sea weeds** are medicinal herbs, but requires a lot of skilled man hours to harvest them. I was given the task to make a model to classify these weeds and harvest it using robots. But given the scarce availability of data, I was able to get 25 images from Client. CNNâ€™s were overfitting and took 40 hours to converge with **high BIAS**.
- Finally made a **DETR(data efficient Transformer) with a 60% accuracy**.
- In the end we have to stop the project because of budget constraints in data collection, gained a lot of experience in that project.

3. **(Intern)CURRICULUM DEVELOPER TECHNICAL CONTENT WRITER- MODERN DATA COMPANY MODERN DATA COMPANY**
This is a product based start-up, My main responsibility was to create tutorials and write technical documentation for people wanting to use their product. I learnt a lot about Data Policies, wrote articles about data protection, polished my SQL skills, api-calls, wrote tutorials for developers. 

4. **FREELANCE SELF**
I wrote blogs, taught students Machine learning and Python accross the globe and consulted companies and individuals, with a team of 10 people who work with me and we grow together.

## Talks 
- Got Invited as a [Guest Speaker](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7099910618928877569/)- More than ML.
